Domain : Data mining 

This project includes data extraction from Yelp provided API which contains details and reviews 
on various restaurants in different locations of four different country. We analyzed the data to 
produce accurate and interesting results. 

Some of the project's scope was to analyze the trend in four different states in the United States.

TREND ANALYSIS

-Finding if people in the states considered - Pennsylvania, Nevada, Arizona and Wisconsin are 
going out more during the working days or in the weekends? 
-Finding out if there are any similarities between the states considered? 

PROCEDURE

- Data for each state was collected and analyzed i.e the total number of businesses visited in 
each day of the week with time slots 
(Morning -6:00 AM-11:59 AM,
Afternoon - 12:01 PM-6:00PM and 
Evening-6:00 PM-12:00 PM) was observed. 
- A line graph was plotted for the four states considered.
- The results were matching with the predictions (People tend to go out more during the 
weekdays than weekends). 
- Also, from the line graph we could observe similarities between states.

EVALUATION

- When the line graph was observed through naked eye, Nevada and Arizona seemed similar i.e 
During the weekends alone, there was a drastic drop on Saturday and sudden increase on Sunday.
- Also, states Pennsylvania and Wisconsin appeared to be similar i.e. During the weekends there
is a gradual decrease in the businesses visited. 
- So, to confirm this similarity Normalization(Min-Max) technique was used.

CONCLUSION

- People tend to go out more during the weekdays than weekends. 
- The results of the normalization showed that Nevada-Arizona were similar. 

Whereas our prediction of Pennsylvania-Wisconsin being similar did not match.
